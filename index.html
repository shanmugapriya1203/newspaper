            <h2>The inventor of the iPod on why Apple hasn't been doing the right thing</h2>
            <p>Tony Fadell, the man behind the invention of the iPod, is of the view that Apple should move the iPhone to USB-C. As per Fadell, this decision would be “the right thing to do.” Fadell shared his opinions recently on Twitter after a user asked him if he believed that the EU’s recent law requiring consumer electronics manufacturers to switch to USB-C charging would put the next iPod by Apple in jeopardy. The American engineer said that he is not too worried about the regulation.
                “I can’t see a problem. The world has converged on USB-C. The physical & user limits have been hit. Next up is wireless per, not a diff physical connection. So I’m not too worried about this regulation. They’re simply forcing Apple to do the right thing… it’s overdue frankly.”, said Fadell, responding to the query posed to him.</p>
